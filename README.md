# Data Science Portfolio

A growing collection of projects built as part of my MS in Data Science.

My background is in development and M&E, so many of my projects focus on
understanding real-world contexts, comparing patterns across populations,
and communicating insights clearly and not just building models.

## Projects

### Global Health Statistics Explorer
Interactive dashboard built with **Shiny for Python** to explore:
- Disease burden, mortality, and recovery
